👋 About Me

I'm Solomon Smith, a Computer Science major at CSU San Bernardino. As a future AI engineer, I'm focused on building machine learning and deep learning systems, mastering frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and staying at the forefront of state-of-the-art NLP, image, and video understanding models.
🌟 What You’ll Find Here

This site serves as my professional portfolio, a collection of my projects, and a platform for sharing my thoughts on technology, diversity in tech, and personal growth.
📚 Projects

Check out some of the projects I’m working on:

Python & GitHub Learning Projects: I’m in the midst of a 12-week plan to refine my skills in Python and GitHub, updating my GitHub with new projects each week.
C++ Learning Plan: Complementing my Python journey, I’m also exploring C++ with another structured 12-week learning plan.
 AI & Machine Learning: Dive into some of my experiments with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other deep learning frameworks as I build a foundation in AI engineering.

More details and links to individual projects are available in this site's “Projects” section.
💻 Technology Stack

This site is created with:

GitHub Pages for hosting
Jekyll as a static site generator
Markdown (.md files) for content organization

I’m also using Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE, and I use GitHub Desktop for version control on my MacBook.
🎯 Goals

In the next few years, I aim to:

Gain publication experience in top-tier conferences and journals
Build cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning systems
Contribute to increasing diversity within the tech industry
Grow as a self-starter in a dynamic, fast-paced environment
